# How to create a recipe





### Instructions


### Ingredients

ingredients in your recipe are indicated with surounding `{}`, eg. `{white bread}` or `{can of tomato soup}`. If your ingredient has a quantity and/or unit, use a `|` to separate the quantity/units from the name, eg. `{2 slices | white bread}`, `{1/2tsp|cinnamon}`. This lets TasteBase parse out the quantities in order to automatically scale amounts based on servings, and allow for unit conversions (if possible).

### Notes

You can also add notes to your recipe. This is useful if it's a work in progress, or you want to make a note of something you'd like to change next time. This syntax is the same as programming style comments; both single line and multiline comments are supportted.

By default these are hidden, but a user can toggle them on in the UI.
